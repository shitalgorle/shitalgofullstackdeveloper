        Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of
        T20I rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the
        number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In
        2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.
