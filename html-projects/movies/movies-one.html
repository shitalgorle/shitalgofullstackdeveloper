    musical[5] sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who

    officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of
    learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.
